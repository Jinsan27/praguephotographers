                  I highly recommend this experience! It was my first time to go on a solo trip abroad and since no one will take photos of me, I thought of having a professional take my photos. It was more than I expected! David was so nice and accommodating and the photos came out really nice! I liked that the shoot was personal. It incorporated a walking tour and with a coffee stopover along the way. I canâ€™t stop sharing my experience with my friends and colleagues right after the trip!

              As a solo traveller, this is one of the best decisions I've taken on my trip. David Took me to all of the spots I was interested in, inquired about my expectations prior, had great general knowledge, with fun facts about Prague and the discussion on several topics became fluid. In consequence, making the process of posing in front of a camera-less daunting and more entertaining. He truly captured my true "Awe" essence in the photo album! FAST turnaround time! I would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat!

They really understood my type of pics and they let me have the best experience:)! Thank you and I hope Iâ€™ll get to see u guys again.

              This photo tour was the highlight of our stay in Prague. David was a wonderful tour guide. He was very friendly, thoughtful, and interesting. He showed us his favourite parts of the city, many of which we would not have discovered on our own. Often we were able to avoid crowds thanks to his guidance. It was easy to spend time together and we ended the tour in a great mood with a new appreciation for the city. David also had great tips on where to eat. Whether you are staying in Prague for a day or a week I would highly recommend this tour.
